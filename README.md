# Node.js REST API Edrans Coding Challenge

This repo consists of a REST API written in Node.js aiming to keep a record of Students, Subjects and Courses of Study at a university.

A Subject can belong to one or more Courses; a Student signs up for one Course and then signs up for one or more Subjects in that Course. Upon completion of each subject, its state and its associated grade are updated.

## TO-DOs:

* Instructions on how to run and consume the API along with some examples
* How to run the automated tests for this system
* Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
