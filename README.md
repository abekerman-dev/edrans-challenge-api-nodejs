# Node.js REST API Edrans Coding Challenge

This repo consists of a REST API written in Node.js aiming to keep a record of majors, subjects, and students at a university.

A subject can belong to one or more majors; a student signs up for one major and then signs up for one or more subjects in that major. Upon completion of each subject, its state and its associated term grade are updated.

## TO-DOs:

* Instructions on how to run and consume the API along with some examples
* How to run the automated tests for this system
* Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
